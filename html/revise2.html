                Just imagine: In this digital era, you making all your payments and transactions standing in a queue outside the office. It’s Nerve-wracking, right? To get you out of this situation, when the Internet was one of the luxurious things we Nepalese enjoyed, eSewa came into existence. With over a decade of operation, we have been able to simplify the lives of Nepalese by facilitating seamless daily life bill payment processes.
